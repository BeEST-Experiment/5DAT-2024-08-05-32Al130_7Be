# XIA Calibration using Laser

After tagging, the definition of multiplicity must be redone. This is because most of the data is laser and it's hard to tell where the multiplicity one events are underneath the laser events. However, after tagging using modulo and plotting only the anticoincident events, the multiplicity one events are visible.

## Good Datasets

From looking at [the output](../out/xia-to-feather/2024-08-06/sum-nuclear_data-m1_threshold.png), there seems to be a good amount of nuclear data in the 2024-08-06 dataset.

# To-Do

- [ ] Update the calibration notebooks from `6ALY/laser-prep`, separating out calibration from tagging.
